# Contribution

We welcome input and contributions. This outlines how to propose a change to rWinePredictor.

Submissions are accepted under the Project's license. 

## Conduct

Contributors must follow the project code of conduct. By contributing, you have accepted the terms of the code of conduct. 

It must also be noted that input and contributions are not confidential. 

## Workflow

### Creating a Branch

Once your local environment is up-to-date, you can create a new git branch which will contain your changes. Create a new branch instead of making changes to the main branch:

```cmd
git switch -c <your-branch-name>
```

### Creating a Pull Request

When you are done with your changes, commit them to your branch:

```cmd
git add <file-name>
git commit -m "Description about changes"
git push origin <your-branch-name>
```

Then, submit a pull request on GitHub asking to merge your example branch into the main repository.

## Pull requests and Issues

Before you make a substantial pull request, an issue should be filed and agreed upon by a team member. Typos and bugs should also be submitted via an issue. Add a clear description to your pull request submission.

If applicable, create a Git branch for each pull request in order to maintain organization. 

There is no strict style guide for the project, but aim for readability and uniformity.
